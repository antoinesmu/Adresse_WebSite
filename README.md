Visitor

<p style="text-align: justify">A person visits our website in order to find a place to eat this evening. First, she can choose one of the restaurants randomly displayed on our homepage or she can click on "Restaurants" and get a list of all the restaurants display on the website. From this tab, she can type in the name, the type, the location or the specialty of a restaurant in the search bar to refine their search. Once a restaurant has been chosen, the user can go to the details page of the restaurant by clicking on "En savoir plus". Then, she will have access to detailed information about the restaurant, including its location, a photo and a list of comments posted by other users. If she wishes, she can go back to the list of restaurants by using the navigation bar or the redirection provided. To get more functionalities, she can register and create an account from the "S'inscrire" button on the login page. </p>

She will have access to a page with the list of all users with an account and she will be able to either delete a user or assign him a new role by switching the button. The same list of restaurants is still available but this time she will be able to modify information or delete it. </p>
